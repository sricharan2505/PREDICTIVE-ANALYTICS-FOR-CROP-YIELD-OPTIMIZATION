PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS FOR CROP YIELD OPTIMIZATION

This project explores the use of predictive analytics to forecast crop yields based on historical data, weather patterns, soil conditions, and farming practices. By applying machine learning algorithms, the system aims to provide farmers with actionable insights to enhance productivity, minimize risks, and make informed decisions about planting and harvesting times. The goal is to maximize crop output while ensuring sustainable farming practices.
